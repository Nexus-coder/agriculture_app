# Mushroom Agriculture App

## Introduction
This is a mushroom agriculture e-commerce app the simple prpose of the app is to help mushroom farmers make sales based on their production of mushrooms the app is really cool and build on express which is a node framework and also plain css,javascript and html for the frontend.

## Challenges
- Having the right design principles and pattern is a huge bottleneck but i am planing on usung the mvc architecture in order to make something that is understandable to many an also really maintainable.
- Sending a multipart form to the frontend is an issue currently  since it is simply not working
